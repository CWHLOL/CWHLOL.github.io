    <h1> Hi name is Celia, Welcome to my page! </h1>
    <p> I am a student at Wa Ora Montessori school. Like nobody has ever heard of my school because it is so tiny, only 300 students go here.
    If you compare that to like HVHS or HIBS then we have like 10% that they do. </p>
    <p> I think that also the reason our school is small is because nobody has ever heard of it. All of my friends outside of school think 
    my school is like a gluten free school or something like that. Like seriously, WHAT??? Like if thats what students think, what are people teaching you? anyway, our school is pretty awesome. if you want to see our school..
