  <h1> This is a story about a girl called Gina </h1>
  
  <p>I moaned softly to myself as I compelled my battered legs to carry me 
for the last time along the overgrown garden path, which I had once 
skipped down so carelessly as a young girl. I sighed as I surveyed the 
acres; once beautifully manicured, but now an utterly disheveled 
expanse of garden stretching before me. My gaze rested on the immense 
oak tree that cut into the landscape, once majestic and verdurous but 
now withered and dying. I apprehensively forced my eyes to look 
directly ahead of me and focused them upon the house that had once 
given me so much happiness as a girl. I mocked myself for thinking that 
I could bring those memories back. I let my eyes rove over the house, 
visualizing the rooms behind the now cracked and distorted windows. I 
felt my heart begin to beat faster as I saw the one I was looking for. 
It was now boarded up; concealing the room I had come to see. My 
vision momentarily flittered over the incoherent, gaudily coloured 
car that had brought me so far, but there was no turning back; not 
now, not ever. I shouldered my backpack and walked towards the cobbled sidewalk, my feet dragging, my neck daring me to turn my head for a last look at the building that had cost me so much, so much pain.My vision suddenly became blurry, I shook my head, trying to clear it. I had to do this by myself, there was no other way, only forward. </p>

<p> It was cold and windy, my feet ached and I could feel two day old mud in my shoes. But it was all worth it, because I had reached the spot where April died. I leaned against a tree, panting. If I hadn’t felt a confusing mixture of tired, sore and downright depressed, I would have enjoyed the scenery. April loved it, I knew she did. Just being here, at the very place where April took her last exhalation of breath, made me want to cry.  I stared over the edge of the crumbling ridge that I stood on, just beyond the long river, which was a vigorous and optimistic blue, the end of which opened out into the mouth of a thick and sulfurous stream.  All three sides of the tall and quite lapidarian valley were draped in a thick layer of mist, tumbling over the mountains like a large, achromatic cloak. Everywhere I turned, there was forest, its intertwining branches linked together like a stratified web. “Rivers are Natures Highways” April always told me. But she was wrong. It had been her death. I was suddenly overwhelmed, as I stood there, on the edge of ridge. Aprils whole life had been a lie, a fraudulence upon her existence. As I stared up at the darkening sky, rage burning in my heart, my foot slipped. I was tumbling , plunging of the ridge, my head spinning. I felt my heart stop as I could see the ridge becoming further and further away. I was going to be like April, I was going to die. I could sense the turbulence of the river drawing me in, like I was another precipitation from the clouds. I braced myself, ready to fall. But I didn’t. I felt myself hit something soft, like a pair of entwining hands, and I was floating, and, as my consciousness  slipped away, I could hear a voice, April’s voice, “Don’t wake up Gina, Don’t wake up” it said, as I fell, once more into a state of illiteracy. </p>

<p> When I woke, all I saw was an empty blue vacuousness that was the sky.
“April” I croaked.
It was a while before I realized where I was, on a bank next to the mouth of a river, its swirling empty blue blankness was somewhat at odds with the supple logs residing in its depths. The embouchement of the valley, loomed on either side of me, it's scabrous sides chipped by the wind. 
“Beautiful, isn’t it?” I sat up. A girl was standing beside me, a girl with a face so ascertainable to April, it could be nobody else.
“What am I doing here” I started “How…” 
“Rivers are Natures Highways, big sister” April said “They travel faster than you think”
Choosing not to retaliate, I said instead what was most on my mind: “Why am I here?” I asked
“Because” April took a deep breath “because ever since my death, you have been so worried about me, and what happened to me. You have to live your own life, not worry about mine. Gina, don't be afraid of death; be afraid of unlived life. You don't have to live forever, you just have to live. When you go back, remember this, don't be afraid of what you know nothing about. Understand?” 
I nod. “Goodbye big sister” April said
Suddenly my brain is exploded with questions I need to ask, things I need to say, but April is already turning away, and my consciousness has began to fade. “ I love you April” I try to say, before my head, once again, goes black. </p>

<p>“You slipped off a cliff, and then, what happened?” a burly man asks me. He has been asking me questions all morning, yet he is still not satisfied. 
“I fell in the river and then….” I pause , I am about to tell him about april, but something holds me back. “yes” he encourages “I got washed away” I finished. “And then a helicopter brought me to the hospital” 
“But..” he says, looking uncertain “that's another thing, how did you float away so fast?, I suppose you wouldn’t have any idea would you?” 
“Well” I say,my face breaking into a smile “Rivers are Natures Highways, they travel faster than you think” </p>
